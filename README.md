# KSP Delta-V Calculator 

In order to calculate the Delta-V needed for a mission to another body, there are several formulas used. These take into account the distance and various orbital mechanics in order to end up with the required Delta-V. 

For more information on the formulas used, please see the KPS official Wiki: https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/

I also highly recommend taking a look at the KPS Reddit page for more information about how to calculate delta-v:  https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/

Please note that this program is still in a prototype phase, and the final Delta-V amounts may varyâ€¦ 

Any and all suggestions welcome!

If you are planning on actually using this to work out your DV, I would suggest adding a couple of struts and possible double down on your fuel! You never know. 

Fly Safe!
